What is it from Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that prevents us from paralelization process?
This was s a question that stuburned me since I was first introduced by it in my Bachelors specialiazed in Statistical Physics for Ising Spin models.
The more I questioned the explanation, the much clearer it became to me that indeed it was parallelizable after all.
I will give the explanation based on my beloved Isig Model and all other models can be either developed analogous to or based from my structured algorithm.
